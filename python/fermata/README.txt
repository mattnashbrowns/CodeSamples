fermata -- A prototype utility for managing information gathered from alliance members, and for automating certain tasks (Not implemented). Created while trying to learn the GAE system, and relearn Python.

While trying to describe what is in this tree, I realized how horribly screwed this design is.
Good thing it is getting rebooted.

Files in this directory:
f_data.py -- Data object definitions for the GAE ORM
f_server.py -- Utilties for interacting with the TLE server on a lower level.
f_loaders.py -- Loader functions for turning JSON into ORM objects as defined in f_data.py
f_util.py -- Miscellaneous utility functions 
f_tle.py -- functions for getting reports from the TLE server
fermata.py -- the main front-end application
