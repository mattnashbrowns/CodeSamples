Python projects I have worked on.

Currently just the one -- fermata, a helper application for managing and participating in an alliance in The Lacuna Expanse, a freemium web game which is written in Perl. I stopped working on the Google App Engine Python version of fermata when I realized it shouldbe written in Perl instead. Since the Moose class, I am ready to try it out with Moose and Catalyst.
