Some samples of previous Perl work

newblast.pl -- A local biotech company hired me to fix a script that they had used to screen DNA sequences. The existing script was horribly complicated, old-school Perl that generated a nice-looking Excel spreadsheet (when it worked) but really went around its elbow to do it. I rewrote the script from scratch, using some Bioperl modules to make things much, much simpler. The original script hand-coded DNA-to-protein translation! Do you know how crazy that is?

senior-design -- This directory holds Perl code that I wrote for my senior design project.
